# What is the difference between keyword and word

The answer is very simple and quite interesting. 

# Keyword 
Anything that has a particular meaning in JS language and has a task assign to it is called a keyword. You cannot declare a variable with the name of a keyword. I will tell you the names of some commonly used keywords in JS.

>example

1. if
2. let
3. else
4. else if
5. this
6. for
7. while
8. do
9. break
10. switch

# word
Anything that doesn't have a particular meaning in JS and doesn't have a particular task assigned to it is called a word.

>example

1. and
2. name
3. username
4. age, etc
