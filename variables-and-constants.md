# What are variables and constants in JS?

In JavaScript, before ES6 you could declare variable by using var, But in ES6 let comes into the picture and you can declare variables using let and var both in JS

In JavaScript, you can also declare constants by using the const keyword which also comes in ES6.

## Important Notes.

1. You can declare a variable with var, you can initialize value in them, and reinitialize value and you can also redeclare the same variable.

2. You can declare a variable using let, you can initialize a value in them and reinitialize the value but you cannot redeclare the same variable.

3. You can declare a constant using const in Js, you cannot reinitialize their value after once initialized, and you cannot redeclare them.
